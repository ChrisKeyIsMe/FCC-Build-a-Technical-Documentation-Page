        <h3>Arabica</h3>
        <p>Believed to have been the first species of coffee bean cultivated by humans, Arabica beans are longer and typically darker than Robusta. The coffee produced from Arabica beans is described as very smooth, with low acidity and caffeiene. Arabica is typically grown in tropical climates, like those found in: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ethiopia</li>
          <li>India</li>
          <li>Guatemala</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Robusta</h3>
        <p>Arguably the most popular and widely-consumed type of coffee on earth, Robusta offers higher acidity and more caffienated cups than its Arabica counterpart. The most popular locations for growing Robusta beans are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vietnam</li>
          <li>Brazil</li>
          <li>Uganda</li>

        <p>Drip coffee makers are the most widely-used type of coffee maker in the world. They create coffee by pouring hot water through the top of fine coffee grounds. The coffee falls into a large pot below the grounds to be shared by multiple people (or one person in SERIOUS need of caffeine).</p>
        <p>These pots are excellent for making coffee while doing something else, as they'll follow a set routine for brewing coffee at the press of a button.</p>
        <code>How to use:</code>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill up the pot to one of the fill lines based on how much coffee you want.</li>
          <li>As per the instructions, use an amount of coffee grounds appropriate for the amount of water you've used.</li>
          <code>The most common ratio is 17:1 - 10g of coffee per 6 fl oz. of water.</code>
        </ol>

        <p>Small, elegant and (usually) affordable - the French Press is great for making a satisfying cup for one.</p>
        <p>The first patent of a French press that resembles what we use today was patented by the Italians Attilio Calimani and Giulio Moneta in 1929. It works by immersing coarse coffee grounds in very hot water to brew. The plunger at the top presses a fine mesh stopper down onto the coffee grounds, trapping them at the bottom of the carafe while allowing the freshly-brewed coffee to seep through for pouring. This results in a full-bodied coffee.</p>
        <p>Note that you while you can use finely-ground coffee, coarse grounds are preferred as these are less likely to escape through the mesh. A simple coffee-water ratio for most French presses is 15:1 - that is, 15 grams of coffee grounds per 225 ml of water.</p>
        <code>How to use:</code>
        <ol>
          <li>Identify how many ml of water your French Press can hold, then measure an appropriate amount of coffee.</li>
          <li>While heating your water, pour your coffee grounds into the carafe. Ideally, water should be just below boiling (~90 degrees Celcius / 195 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
          <li>Slowly pour the water over the grounds, being sure to soak all of the grounds evenly. Stop when the carafe is half full of water.</li>
          <li>Slowly stir the mixture for 30 seconds before adding the remaining water to the fill line (usually, this line is about where the top of the handle meets the carafe).</li>
          <li>Cover the coffee and leave to brew for 3-5 minutes. Afterwards, press the plunger down slowly and serve!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>One great method for making a single cup of coffee is using a pour over. This involves using a special device that is placed over top of the coffee mug or glass. This device is then fitted with a standard coffee filter (like one used in a drip coffee maker) and filled coffee grounds.</p>
        <p>Many coffee enthusiasts prefer this method of preparation for the satisfaction it provides as well as its overall simplicity. Generally, a good coffee to water ratio is between 12:1 and 17:1</p>
        <code>How to use:</code>
        <ol>
          <li>While boiling your water, add a filter and an appropriate amount of coffee grounds into your topper.</li>
          <li>Slowly pour hot water over the grounds in a circular motion. At first, you'll only want to add enough water to wet all of the grounds slightly.</li>
          <li>The right way to pour over coffee is by pouring water slowly over the grounds, in a circular motion. Start at the outer edge of the coffee, the one that hits the filter, and slowly move towards the center, saturating all the grounds evenly.  This should take roughly 15 seconds. Then stop and allow your coffee to drip before making the second pour.</li>
          <li>Wait about 30 seconds, then repeat the above a second time.Starting from the center of the filter, slowly pour in a steady stream of hot water, again in a circular motion, toward the outer edge and then back at the center. Make sure that youâ€™re not missing the outer edges of the beans.</li>
          <li>Wait enough 20-30 seconds, then repeat the pour again. You may also opt to do this a fourth time if you still have space in your cup. Enjoy!</li>

        <p>A Moka pot is a small coffee pot. It will typically have eight sides to it. Some of the best are Italian-made and they are typically found in older kitchens, especially in Europe. And while a traditional piece is an option, most people will purchase a new Moka pot to use at home. In short, this is the ideal pot to make your espresso in.</p>
        <p>This simple tool requires no electricity to run. Instead, water and coffee are both added to the pot. The pot is then heated and as it heats, the coffee rises to the main section of the pot.</p>
        <code>How to use:</code>
        <ol>
          <li>Boil water and add it to the bottom section of the Moka pot.</li>
          <li>Add coffee grounds the filter basket of the pot.</li>
          <li>Add the top half of the Moka pot.</li>
          <li>Place the completed pot onto the stove and turn on to medium heat.</li>
          <li>Once on the burner, the Moka pot goes to work. The water at the base reaches a boiling point. When this happens, it creates steam. When this happens, steam will push the water through the coffee. Over a few minutes, the upper chamber fills with rich, dark coffee.</li>
